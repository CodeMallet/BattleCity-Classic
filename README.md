# BattleCity Classic

BattleCity Classic was the very first online multiplayer game I ever played in the late 90's.

With permission from the creators I recreated the game completely in C++.  We had a successful run with active players in the mid 2000's.

I have updated some libraries and the game will compile with Visual Studio 2017 Community.  If you run the server and client profiles you will create a localhost server and be able to connect to yourself and play the game.

If you have any questions/comments please email remote@codemallet.com
